when a certain set of neurons begins to work together more often, they become like a well-practiced choir. “Singing together” is in fact how neurons form a sequence of links with one another.

## Long-term memory vs Working Memory
_Long-term memory_ is what it sounds like—it holds the information we’re able to store and bring back to mind from weeks, months, or even years before.

But _working memory_—that temporary holding pattern for thoughts—is different from long-term memory. Rather than sets of links that reside happily in the neocortex, working memory is more like an octopus tossing a set of balls. These balls represent thoughts that bounce over and over again from the front to the back of your brain, as long as you are holding the ideas in working memory.

>Retrieval is far from some simple mindless memorization technique -it also builds conceptual understanding. Is one of the best ways to strengthen neural links in long-term memory.

## The history of Ramon y Cajal
To get a better sense of the advantages of slower learning, we’ll take a look at a Spaniard named Santiago Ramón y Cajal. Cajal was a prototypical hiker student—learning came hard and slow.2 He had a poor working memory, which made it difficult for him to put new information into long-term memory. He also had behavior problems—his antics resulted in his being kicked out of several schools. Cajal wanted to be an artist, but his father wanted him to be a doctor. (This was back in the 1860s. Some things never change.) Ultimately, his father washed his hands of him.

But surprisingly, Cajal would eventually go on to get his doctorate in medicine. As if that weren’t enough, he became so esteemed for his breakthrough research findings in neuroanatomy that he eventually won the Nobel Prize. And as if _that_ weren’t enough, Santiago Ramón y Cajal is now considered the father of modern neuroscience.

What are perhaps equally astonishing are Cajal’s thoughts about how and why he was able to achieve so much.3 His conclusion? That his success arose in part from the fact that he _wasn’t_ a genius. His scientific breakthroughs came precisely _because of_ his slower, more flexible, way of thinking. When Cajal was wrong, he could change his mind. The geniuses he worked with, on the other hand, were used to being right and had little practice in acknowledging and correcting errors. So these race-car brains tended to jump to conclusions with speedy answers, and when they were wrong, they were unable to correct their mistakes. Instead, they’d use their intelligence to find ways to rationalize why they must have been right after all.


>[!danger] Working memory limitation
>Teachers sometimes believe they shouldn't write directions down for students because they think students need to "pay better attention to follow directions." But it's not about paying attention-it's about limited working memory capacity


The intricate relationship between working memory and long-term memory is easily the most critical factor in human cognition. It goes a long way toward understanding how our memory works.
